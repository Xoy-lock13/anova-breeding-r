#  ANOVA automation for breeding/genetics data in R  #

The objective of this code is to make a function/loop which will compute ANOVA.
The sole purpose of this to spread the knowledge of R to make the data analysis easier and less time consuming. 
Because someone might have more than 10 traits. And compute them individually is a hassle and very time consuming.
Here comes the custome functions and loops.
And learning new things are always fun.
